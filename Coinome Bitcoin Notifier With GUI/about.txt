Since I created this script **Coinome **changed their site a bit so above script will not work now.
But worry not, I cooked up tiny App which is much better than above script with GUI and price graph too.
Here are few Snapshots:
**Simple User Interface:**
Simple, no clutter.

**Notifications (Yup with that annoying ting sound :D ):
**You can set buy/sell price alert. And once that price is reached you will get a notification.

**Graphs for making informed investment decision:**
All historical prices extracted from this tool are saved on one text file automatically so you can watch this graph anytime you want.
